# ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Beginner Friendly Project

This project helps you perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on any dataset using Python. It's designed for **beginners**, so donâ€™t worry if youâ€™re just getting started with data analysis or coding!

## ðŸ“Œ What is EDA?

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is the process of summarizing, visualizing, and understanding the key characteristics of data. Before building machine learning models, EDA helps us:

- Understand what the data looks like
- Discover patterns and trends
- Identify outliers and missing values
- Explore relationships between features

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

In this project, you will:

1. Load and inspect a dataset
2. Generate summary statistics
3. Create histograms and boxplots for visualizing distributions and outliers
4. Use pairplots and correlation matrices to analyze feature relationships
5. Identify anomalies or missing values
6. Create interactive plots using Plotly
