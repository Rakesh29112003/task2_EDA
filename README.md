# 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project demonstrates **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset using Python. It includes generating statistical summaries, visualizations, outlier detection, and correlation analysis — all using beginner-friendly tools such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

> ✅ Designed to work on **GitHub** — static plots (like boxplots) will display properly!

## 📁 Files

- `task2.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing all EDA steps
- `data.csv` – The input dataset (you must provide your own if not included)

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand the structure and summary of the dataset
- Visualize distributions using histograms and boxplots
- Identify relationships between features using pairplots and correlation heatmaps
- Detect missing values and potential outliers

---

## 📦 Libraries Used

- `pandas` – For data handling
- `numpy` – For numeric computations
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – For static visualizations (GitHub compatible)
- `plotly` *(optional)* – For interactive charts (not shown on GitHub, but useful locally)
